# Abstract:

Customer reviews are vital in the hospitality industry, influencing travelers' decisions and businesses' reputations. This project classifies hotel reviews from TripAdvisor into two general categories (positive or negative) using machine learning. The raw review text is preprocessed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and explore different classification models, including traditional machine learning classifiers (logistic regression, decision trees, SVM) and deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers). Feature engineering methods such as sentiment scores, topic modeling, and word embeddings are applied to enhance classification performance. To demonstrate the real-world applicability of the model, a web-based application is deployed where users can input a hotel review, and the model will classify it as positive or negative in real-time using the best-performing classifier.
